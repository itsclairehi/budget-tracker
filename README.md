  ## Description
  This app allows you to track your earnings and expenses so you can stay on budget! You can add or subtract money from your total, which is automatically updated. You can also install to your device for offline usage. The functionality was given as starter code, and I added the ability to download and use offline.
  
  ## Installation
  From the website you can press the "+" next to the url, which will download it to your "Chrome Apps" folder
